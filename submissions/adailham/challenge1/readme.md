Introduction: File-based Routing Website
This project is a simple file-based routing website created with HTML and CSS. Each page is represented by a separate HTML file (e.g., index.html, about.html, projects.html), and users can navigate between pages using links.

The website includes four key pages:

Home: Displays name, a short introduction, and links to github.
About: Shares details about your background, skills, and experience.
Projects: Highlights projects you've worked on, with brief descriptions.
All pages share a consistent navigation bar, making it easy for visitors to explore the site.
