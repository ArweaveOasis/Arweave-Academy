### Introduce Yourself
 Hi! My name is PortesDOlores, and I’m a freshman in the world of Node operations, running, and development. I’m excited to dive deep into the intricacies of Node.js and its ecosystem, and I’m eager to explore how nodes function in decentralized networks, run efficiently, and help power innovative applications. Although I’m still in the early stages of my journey, my enthusiasm for learning is what drives me every day. I am passionate about coding, troubleshooting, and ensuring the optimal performance of nodes, whether it’s by fine-tuning their operations, maintaining uptime, or developing features that enhance their capabilities. I’m really looking forward to connecting with others in this field, sharing knowledge, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible. I’m determined to grow my skills and become a strong asset to any team or community I join, and I’m always open to new ideas and challenges. Let’s build something amazing together!
