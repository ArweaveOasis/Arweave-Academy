The code creates a simple file-based static website consisting of multiple HTML pages: a homepage (index.html), an "About" page (about.html), and a "Contact" page (contact.html). Each page is interlinked using standard <a> tags for easy navigation, reflecting a basic file-based routing structure. A shared external CSS file (styles.css) is used to maintain consistent styling across the pages, including font style and layout enhancements. The structure demonstrates how static websites can be organized and navigated effectively, making it ideal for deployment on Arweave, which supports immutable and serverless storage for lightweight, permanently available websites.
