### Introduce Yourself
I am an experienced professional with deep expertise in Web3 technology, specializing in node development, node operation, and validator management across multiple blockchain ecosystems. My passion lies in building decentralized applications (dApps) and ensuring robust and efficient node infrastructures. I am also deeply interested in exploring AR/AO projects and their integration with Web3, as I believe these technologies have the potential to redefine user experiences and decentralization. Currently, I work as a freelance Web3 developer, validator operator, and node runner, collaborating with diverse projects to enhance decentralization, blockchain performance, and innovative applications of AR/AO within the Web3 ecosystem. With a strong track record in the Web3 space, I am committed to driving innovation and contributing to the growth of decentralized and immersive technologies.
