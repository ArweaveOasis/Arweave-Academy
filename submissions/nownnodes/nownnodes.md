### Introduce Yourself
I’m deeply passionate about building and optimizing dApps across various blockchain networks in the Web3 ecosystem. Currently, I’m working as a freelancer specializing in roles such as node developer, node operator, and node maintainer.
My journey in this space has been driven by a love for innovation and the challenge of creating decentralized solutions that empower communities. I’m always eager to explore new technologies and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain.
Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with others who share the same vision for a decentralized future!
