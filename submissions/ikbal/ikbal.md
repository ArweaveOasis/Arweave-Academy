### Introduce Yourself
I am a biggest enthusiast in developing dApps in many chains in the web3 circle. Iâ€™m currently working as a freelance node developer, node runner, and node operator. I have completed multiple testnet and mainnet projects, which helped me gain hands-on experience in deploying and managing decentralized infrastructures. 

I am passionate about exploring new blockchain technologies, improving system scalability, and contributing to open-source projects. I actively participate in community discussions and love to help others in troubleshooting and understanding complex web3 mechanics.

My goal is to become a full-time blockchain engineer and contribute to innovative solutions in the decentralized space.
