### Introduce Yourself
 I'm crypto enthusiast from Croatia, 34 years old. I'm in crypto for about 8 years now, and I'm running full nodes for several blockchains (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC) and I'm involved in various DePin projects. I also trade/invest in crypto, while it's a realatively small amount it helps me understand blockhains and their nuances.
