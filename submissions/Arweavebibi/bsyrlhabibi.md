### Introduce Yourself
I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and decentralized applications. I specialize in building efficient and scalable systems using Golang, a language I truly enjoy for its simplicity and performance.

In the Web3 space, I have experience as a node developer, node runner, and node operator, managing blockchain nodes and contributing to crypto projects. My goal is to leverage my skills in Golang and my enthusiasm for crypto to build impactful solutions in the decentralized ecosystem.
