### Introduce Yourself
 I have extensive experience in the blockchain ecosystem as a validator and testnet participant. I have actively participated in projects such as Dymension EIBC client, Hemi Network, and Rusk. I specialize in validator operations, network security, and optimization, and contribute to the community by providing a robust and reliable infrastructure across multiple chains.
