# Challenge 1: File-based Routing

## Description
In this first challenge, I built a simple website with multiple HTML files that link to each other and deployed it to the Arweave network. This project demonstrates how to upload static files to Arweave using Bundlr and how to leverage Arweave's permanent storage.

## Available Files
1. **index.html**: The homepage of the website.
2. **about.html**: A page providing more information about the website.

## Deployment on Arweave
All website files have been uploaded to Arweave using Bundlr. Here is the associated Arweave Transaction ID:
- **Transaction ID**: `ze_XNsg6YQ3LccZ3af-RilALvbmkYF65D1lFS5bxGrc`

To view the uploaded files, you can visit [this link](https://arweave.net/ze_XNsg6YQ3LccZ3af-RilALvbmkYF65D1lFS5bxGrc).

## Steps Performed
1. Created simple HTML files for the website.
2. Used Bundlr to upload files to the Arweave network.
3. Verified successful file upload using Arweave Explorer.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for website structure.
- **Bundlr** for uploading files to Arweave.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Update the `wallet.json` file with your wallet information.
3. Run the **upload.js** script to upload the files to Arweave.
4. Check the uploaded files on Arweave Explorer using the Transaction ID.
