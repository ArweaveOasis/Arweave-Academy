### Introduce Yourself
 I am deeply passionate about developing decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms in the Web3 ecosystem. Currently, I work as a freelancer, specializing in roles like Node Developer, Node Runner, and Node Operator. My expertise lies in maintaining and optimizing blockchain infrastructure while contributing to the growth of decentralized technology. I also do degens and trading sometimes.
