Hi,
I'm an Application Support Specialist in the automotive industry with a knack for solving problems and keeping systems running at peak performance. I’m all about efficiency, troubleshooting complex issues, and delivering reliable solutions. Beyond that, I’m one of the biggest enthusiasts in developing decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple chains in the Web3 space. Currently, I’m also working as a freelance Node developer, Node runner, and Node operator, helping drive the future of decentralized technologies
