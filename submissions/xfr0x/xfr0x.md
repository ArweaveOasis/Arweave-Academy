### Introduce Yourself
I’m a passionate backend and fullstack developer, currently diving deep into Web3, blockchain, and smart contract development. My tech stack includes React TypeScript, Laravel, and Node.js, with a growing expertise in Solidity, and Move for blockchain ecosystems.

I thrive on learning new skills, solving complex problems, and creating impactful projects. Right now, I’m also an active community builder for Web3 developers in Indonesia, helping others transition from Web2 to Web3.

My goal is to master Solidity, grow as a smart contract auditor/security researcher, and explore DeFi innovations like AI Agents for DeFi or another narrative.
