# Frontend Challenge 1: File-based Routing

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple website with file-based routing. It consists of three HTML files that link to each other and can be deployed to Arweave or other static hosting platforms.

## Structure
- `index.html`: The homepage with links to About and Contact pages.
- `about.html`: Contains information about the website.
- `contact.html`: A contact form for user inquiries.
- `style.css`: Styles for the website.

## Instructions
1. Open any of the HTML files in a browser to view the website locally.
2. Deploy the files to a static hosting platform (e.g., Arweave) to make them accessible online.

## Deployment
Use a tool like Dragondeploy to deploy the files to Arweave.

## Live Demo
The website is deployed on Arweave using Dragondeploy. You can access it at [Deployed URL](https://arweave.net/K3Ex_Z-jSinPW0sTyxZoPq2s7oWFn4-C1En0NZmLbGI//).
