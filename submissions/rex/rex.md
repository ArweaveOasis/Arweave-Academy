### Introduce Yourself
 Hello, everyone! My name is Avry alias Rex, and I’m thrilled to be part of this vibrant cryptocurrency community.

I’ve been actively involved in the crypto space since 2019, focusing on crypto trading, DeFi, NFTs. My journey started with learning about Bitcoin or exploring smart contracts on Solana, and it has been an exciting ride ever since.

Currently, I’m passionate about Layer-2 scaling solutions, decentralized governance, the potential of Web3, meme trading.

I’m always looking to connect with like-minded individuals to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and grow together in this fast-evolving ecosystem. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss smart contracts, crypto regulations, investment strategies or if there’s any way I can assist.

Looking forward to learning from and contributing to this amazing community!

Best regards, Rex
