title: Why Static Site Generation?
permalink: /about.html

<section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Static site generation (SSG) is a methodology in web development where HTML pages are pre-built at compile time. This makes SSG websites faster, more secure, and scalable. Static sites are ideal for Arweave's permanent storage model because once a page is built, it can be stored on Arweave's decentralized network permanently.</p>
    <p>SSG works perfectly with AR.IO gateways because these gateways don’t support server-side code execution, making static websites the most efficient solution for hosting on Arweave.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Static Site Generation?</h2>
    <p>Static websites are more efficient and cost-effective for many use cases. Here’s why SSG is a great choice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> SSG generates static files that are extremely fast to load since they don't require server-side processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Since there’s no server-side logic involved, there are fewer security vulnerabilities. Static files can't be tampered with on the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Static websites can be served globally with CDNs, ensuring scalability without having to manage server resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> With no need for dynamic back-end systems, hosting a static site is much cheaper and easier to scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Static files are immune to issues like server outages, making them highly reliable and stable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of SSG</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Pre-rendered HTML ensures faster load times by eliminating delays associated with server-side rendering.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Static files reduce the risk of server vulnerabilities. There's no backend to hack, making static sites inherently more secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Static files are easy to distribute and serve globally via Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), making them highly scalable and cost-effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Static sites fit perfectly with the Arweave ecosystem, as their immutability aligns with Arweave's permanent storage model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How SSG Helps Arweave</h2>
    <p>SSG perfectly complements Arweave’s technology. With Arweave, you can store your website permanently, and it is accessible to anyone with the URL without any concerns about server downtime or expiration.</p>
    <p>Arweave’s permanent storage aligns with the concept of immutability, which is a core principle of SSG. Once the website is generated and uploaded to Arweave, it will always be available as it is, without needing any updates or server-side processes.</p>
