            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>File-based routing is an essential method for creating simple, static websites. It aligns perfectly with Arweave's permanent storage model and ensures compatibility with AR.IO gateways that don't execute server-side code.</p>
            <h2>Why Choose This Challenge?</h2>
            <p>This challenge introduces developers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fundamental concepts of Arweave and AO development.</li>
                <li>Best practices for storing data and building applications on Arweave.</li>
                <li>A hands-on experience to prepare for advanced development challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Detailed Benefits</h2>
            <p>Adopting file-based routing offers several advantages:</p>
