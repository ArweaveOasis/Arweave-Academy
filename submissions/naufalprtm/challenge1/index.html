            <h2>Welcome to the School of DumDum</h2>
            <p>Your one-stop journey to mastering Arweave AO development, organized by ArweaveOasis.</p>
            <p>The School of DumDum is part of the Arweave Academy developer education program. We offer developers free, high-quality courses and practical tasks to help them start building applications on Arweave and AO from scratch.</p>
            <p class="special-thanks">Special thanks to @K4y1s, @sayestheorem, @rosmcmahon_real, and @developer_dao for their support, and to @OpenBuildxyz for their guidance and assistance with the event process.</p>
            <p>We divided this program into two sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Beginners can study courses and submit tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Advanced developers can participate in competitions and write tutorials.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Challenge Details</h2>
            <p>This challenge focuses on creating a simple website with multiple HTML files that link to each other and deploying it on Arweave. The goal is to understand the basics of file-based routing, which is a foundational concept in web development. Here are some key points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File-based Routing:</strong> Organize your website into separate HTML files and link them using anchor tags.</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Use tools like Dragondeploy to deploy your website to Arweave for permanent storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Learn how to build static websites that fit Arweave's model and avoid server-side dependencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenge 1 Structure and Example Code</h3>
            <p>This challenge teaches the concept of file-based routing. In this structure, you create multiple HTML pages and link them together using anchor tags. Each page will represent a different part of your website, and the links between them will allow easy navigation.</p>
            
            <h4>Project Structure:</h4>
            <pre>
/project-directory
    /assets
        styles.css
        script.js
    index.html
    about.html
    tools.html
            </pre>

            <h4>Example Code for <code>index.html</code>:</h4>
            <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;File-based Routing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Welcome to the School of DumDum&lt;/h2&gt;

            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            <p>The example above demonstrates the file structure and basic content of the homepage of your website. It uses anchor tags to navigate between three pages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home (index.html):</strong> The main page of the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Why? (about.html):</strong> A page explaining the concept of file-based routing.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools (tools.html):</strong> A page listing tools and resources for deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why File-based Routing?</h3>
            <p>File-based routing is one of the simplest ways to create websites. It avoids the complexity of additional tooling, making it ideal for beginners and small projects. On Arweave, where storage is permanent, this approach ensures that your website remains accessible forever without the need for server-side processing.</p>
            
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>After completing this challenge, developers will be ready to explore advanced topics like static site generation and client-side rendering. These skills are crucial for creating dynamic, scalable applications on the Arweave ecosystem.</p>
