### Introduce Yourself

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for blockchain technology, which I've been actively exploring since 2019. My experience includes building various decentralized applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), staking platforms, and launchpads. I'm proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript and have a strong command of web frameworks like React. Additionally, I'm well-versed in Solidity for smart contract development.
