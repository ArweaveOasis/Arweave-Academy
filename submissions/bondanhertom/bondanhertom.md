### Introduce Yourself

Hi, my name is Bondan Herutomo, an Informatics Engineering graduate from Universitas Pancasila with a GPA of 3.41. I specialize in frontend development and have experience working on various projects, including POS systems, e-commerce platforms, job portals, and storage applications. My expertise spans web and mobile development, with proficiency in Next.js, React Native, Vue.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

I am passionate about problem-solving, innovation, and decentralized technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, football, and engaging in activities like learning English and participating in airdrop hunting.
