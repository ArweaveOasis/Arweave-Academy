### Introduce Yourself

I’m Jane Ezike, a Web3 enthusiast with a passion for decentralized technologies and their potential to revolutionize how we store and share information. I’m particularly inspired by the Arweave ecosystem and its mission to create a permanent, decentralized web for everyone.

I believe in leveraging blockchain technology to build solutions that empower communities and foster innovation. My journey in Web3 development is driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully to projects that promote sustainability, transparency, and equitable access to information.
