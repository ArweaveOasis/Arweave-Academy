        <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate on a technology called blockchain, which ensures secure and transparent transactions.</p>
        
        <h3>The Birth of Bitcoin</h3>
        <p>The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), was created in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency that could be sent peer-to-peer without the need for intermediaries like banks.</p>

        <h3>How Cryptocurrency Works</h3>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This ensures that transactions are secure and cannot be tampered with. Miners use computational power to validate transactions, and in return, they are rewarded with cryptocurrency.</p>

        <h3>Popular Cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong> The original and most well-known cryptocurrency.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong> A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Ripple (XRP):</strong> A digital payment protocol designed for fast and low-cost international money transfers.</li>
            <li><strong>Litecoin (LTC):</strong> A peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that is often considered a "lighter" version of Bitcoin.</li>
