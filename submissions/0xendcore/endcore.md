### Introduce Yourself
I am a passionate developer focused on building decentralized applications (dApps) within the EVM and Substrate ecosystems. My current work revolves around projects primarily based on EVM-compatible chains. Additionally, I have a deep interest in running nodes and operating as a node operator, combining my technical expertise with hands-on involvement in Web3 infrastructure.
