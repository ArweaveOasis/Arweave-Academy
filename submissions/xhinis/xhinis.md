### Introduce Yourself
I'm dedicated node operator with 5 years of experience managing infrastructure across various blockchain ecosystems, including Arweave, Cosmos, Celestia, and more. Over the years, I’ve developed expertise in optimizing performance, ensuring network reliability, and contributing to the decentralization and scalability of these networks. I’m passionate about supporting the growth of the Arweave/AO ecosystem by providing a stable and secure node infrastructure while collaborating with the community to make node operation more streamlined and accessible for others.
