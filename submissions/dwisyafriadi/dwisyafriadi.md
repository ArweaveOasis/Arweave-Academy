### Introduce Yourself
 I am a dabase engineer, besides that I am active and I have the greatest enthusiasm in developing dApps in many chains in the web3 circle, currently I am working as a freelancer in node developer, node runner, node operator, etc. I have also been a node validator, one of which is wasm, taiko, casm, exlir. In addition, I also actively create automation scripts for installing node validators.
