### Introduce Yourself
 hi im stressa, and im excited to start my Web3 journey! i love learning new things, and im really interested in the AO and Arweave ecosystem. i see a lot of potential in this space, and im excited to see how it grows in the future. im looking forward to learning more and being part of this journey. even though im no tech expert, im always curious about how things work. thats what led me to Web3. ive also been curious about GitHub, and i didnâ€™t expect that my favorite ecosystem, AO/Arweave, would have a learning academy on GitHub. this is why I decided to sign up, to learn more and get involved with the community. im excited to see where this journey takes me!
