### Introduce Yourself
 Hello Arweave Academy Community,

My name is Lukehariw, and I’m thrilled to be part of this exciting platform. I’m a beginner programmer with a growing passion for decentralized storage and blockchain technology. I recently started exploring web development and am eager to dive into Arweave's ecosystem to enhance my skills and knowledge.

I’m particularly interested in learning about the permaweb and how Arweave empowers decentralized and permanent data storage. I’m here to absorb all the knowledge I can, connect with fellow learners and experts, and hopefully contribute to the community someday.

If you have any resources, beginner-friendly tips, or projects I can learn from, I’d love to hear about them!

Looking forward to learning and building with all of you!

Best,
Lukehariw
