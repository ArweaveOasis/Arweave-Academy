### Introduce Yourself

Hi, I'm Maxis, a passionate Web3 enthusiast with a strong focus on developing decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain networks. I thrive in the fast-paced innovative environment of blockchain technology and am currently working as a freelance node developer, node runner, and node operator.

My journey in the blockchain space has been driven by a deep curiosity and passion for distributed ledger technologies and their potential to revolutionize industries. I've gained substantial experience in deploying and managing nodes, as well as contributing to various open-source projects that leverage blockchain technology for real-world applications.

I am always eager to collaborate with other enthusiastic individuals and teams to push the boundaries of what's possible in the blockchain ecosystem. My commitment to continuous learning and improvement ensures that I remain at the cutting edge of this rapidly evolving field.

Looking forward to contributing more and learning within the Arweave community!
