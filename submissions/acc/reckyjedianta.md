### Introduce Yourself
Hello! My name is Recky Jedianta Riady, and I am from Indonesia. I am a passionate enthusiast in blockchain technology and a dedicated developer of dApps across various web3 ecosystems. Over the past few years, I have been deeply immersed in the web3 space, particularly in testnets and node operations.

As a freelancer, I have extensive experience as a node developer, runner, and operator, ensuring blockchain networks run smoothly while contributing to the stability and decentralization of the ecosystem. My interests in web3 include developing decentralized applications (dApps), experimenting with the latest testnets, and exploring opportunities across multiple blockchain platforms.

I firmly believe that blockchain technology has the potential to create a more inclusive and transparent world. I am always excited to collaborate with the community and bring innovative solutions to life.
